	'question1_content'=>"When a client has made and paid for a lesson, you will receive an e-mail with their contact details and the number of hours booked. Please contact them as soon as possible to schedule the first lesson.<br><br> 

	When a time and date is agreed, go into ‘Students’ in the dashboard where you should see their name, email and phone number. Click on ‘Create a lesson’.  Enter in all details including number of students and location of the court. Click ‘Save’. This will then send a confirmation email to your client with all the details of time, date and location.<br><br> 

	After the lesson has taken place, please go into the system under ‘Lessons’ and mark ‘Completed’.<br><br> 

	If you need to cancel a lesson or reschedule, please go into ‘Lessons’ in the dashboard and select the lesson and click on ‘Reschedule’.  You can change the lesson details and click ‘Update’. Your client will receive an email with the new details. Alternatively you can click ‘Cancel Lesson’ and your client will receive notification that the lesson has been cancelled.",
	
	'paid_content' => 'We will pay you every two weeks for marked and completed hours. It is your responsibility to mark as completed. We will agree the best way to get payment to you, but we will typically make payment using bank transfer or PayPal. You agree to take responsibility to pay the relevant social security and taxation to your local government. ',
	
	'customers' => "Ask you client if they have any particular preference, and also feel free to make recommendations of courts or clubs you know in the area and are comfortable coaching at. Be sure to inform your client about the price of the court and discuss who is responsible for booking and paying for the court so that there is no miscommunication. If there is a specific dress code at the club, be sure to inform your client as well as to specify what type of court and therefore footwear they should have.",
	
	'cancellation' => "We require that clients provide 48 hours notice of cancellation on the first booking with a coach or 24 hours thereafter. You are welcome to use your discretion in reschedule a missed/forfeited lesson. We request that coaches provide as much notice as possible to clients if they need to cancel and to try to reschedule as soon as possible. <br><br> 

If the weather looks as if it will be bad or is bad, then please use your judgment to decide whether it is worthwhile playing. Discuss with your client and come to a mutual agreement to reschedule. Put the safety of the client and enjoyment of the lesson first. ",
	
	'reschedule' => 'If the weather is iffy, reach out to your client directly to reschedule the lesson. Be sure and update the lesson details on your My Lessons page by using the reschedule button.',


	'question6_content'=>'If the client is late they forfeit the right to the time lost and will still be charged for a full lesson. The coach should not be late and make every attempt to be early for a lesson. But we understand that life does happen. In this case the coach should always make up for any time lost at the end of the lesson or in future lessons. If the coach is more than 15 minutes late and the time is not made up, the lesson fee will be adjusted accordingly. As a gesture of goodwill to our clients, we also have a policy that if the coach is more than 30 minutes late then the lesson is free. This means that you, as the coach will not get paid for the time and nor will we. But this will hopefully help to secure repeat bookings benefitting involved.',

	'question7_content'=>'Strictly the lesson fee only. You will be able to see the number of lesson credits available to each client has whether additional players have been requested. Each lesson credit equals an hour’s play. The coach is required to provide balls but you can agree separately with clients if they require new balls or any other additional equipment. The court fee is not included in the booking. Be sure to remind your client of this.',

	'question9_content'=>"We recommend that you take out your own personal liability insurance where appropriate. As we have no control over when and where the lessons take place we do not assume any liability."
